# PushQuantum_Qiskit_Fall_Fest_2025

We host here the Notebooks for the Qiskit Fall Fest 2025 hosted by PushQuantum.

First of all thanks for your participation. If you want to ask any questions regarding any of these notebooks please join the Discord in the Email you got for the event. 

Other than that, there is no real Todo. The easiest way to start is by cloning this repository and then trying the Challenges. In many cases there is no right or wrong answer. 

Please keep in mind that we are just learning like you do and do all this stuff on a volunteering basis, so you can expect that some things break, are not clear or straight up don't work. However we will try our best to let you have a nice exprience. 

We plan these notebooks to be a bit deeper then the small introduction at the beginning of the Fall Fest. There is no specific order in which you need to do these notebooks or anything. Just take your time and learn how qiskit works and how to work with a quantum computer.
